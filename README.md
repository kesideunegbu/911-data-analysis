# 911-data-analysis
This project analyzes 911 calls using a dataset provided by Kaggle. I used python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and plotly to perform Exploratory data analysis. I also use these tools to anser various questions about the data and derive insights from that data. I also use these tools to visualize the data so I'm able to see the data clearly.
